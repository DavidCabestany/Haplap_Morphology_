# Computational Morphology

Welcome to the "Computational Morphology" repository! This repository contains my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks from the course on Computational Morphology.

## Course Description

The main objective of this course is to present the main concepts and models for the computational treatment of morphology, including regular expressions, finite-state automata, and more. The course primarily focuses on languages with rich morphology. Throughout the course, students will utilize the foma tool, a free and open-source tool for finite-state processing. Additionally, the course introduces neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models as applied to morphology, utilizing the OpenNMT tool.

## Syllabus

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Introduction**: An overview of the course and its objectives.

2. **Formal Languages and Their Applications**:
   - Basic concepts in formal languages.
   - Regular languages and their importance in computational morphology.

3. **Morphology**:
   - Formalisms for computational morphology.
   - Morphotactics and Phonology, exploring phenomena in several languages.
   - Finite-State Morphology, with examples and problems using FOMA for Lexicon, Morphology, and Surface-Syntax.
   - Morphological analysis and generation using seq2seq methods.

## Assignments

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks given during the course. Each assignment is organized into separate directories, and the solutions are provided in the form of code, notebooks, or reports, as applicable.

## Note

These solutions are intended to serve as references and examples for fellow students. If you are currently enrolled in the same course, I encourage you to attempt the assignments independently before referring to these solutions.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions can aid your understanding of computational morphology concepts and implementations, please refrain from submitting them as your own work for grading purposes. Upholding academic integrity is of utmost importance.
